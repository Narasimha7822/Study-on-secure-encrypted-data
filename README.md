# Study-on-secure-encrypted-data
We propose to theoretically study various schemes proposed by authors which are secure and  efficient and use the concept of Analysis of encrypted data techniques. We can conduct this  study through this project, the objective is to secure data with user conveniences. The proposed  Secure File System (SFS), we have designed, provides file data security using cryptographic  techniques in a transparent and convenient way. SFS requires that the user creates a directory and  name it with the prefix 'encrypt' to store the encrypted file data. here we will be studying some  algorithms which a few a part of this concept. We will be seeing brief explanation of those  algorithms.
